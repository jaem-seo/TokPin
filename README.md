# [TokPin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1738573324003644?via%3Dihub): Tokamak transport simulation with PINN
- This repo shows a simple demonstration of solving the tokamak transport equation with PINN.
- Using PINN can have potential benefits: synergy with parallel computing, numerical stability, and semi-predictive simulation.

# Note
- It uses a simplified geometry and heating profile, so there is room for further development!
- The saved weights and plots were generated with RTX-3080Ti GPU.
